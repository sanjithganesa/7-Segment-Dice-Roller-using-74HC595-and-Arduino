# 7-Segment-Dice-Roller-using-74HC595-and-Arduino
This project demonstrates how to use a 74HC595 shift register to control a common cathode (CC) or common anode (CA) 7-segment display with an Arduino. It simulates a dice roll when a button is pressed, randomly displaying values between 1 and 6 on the 7-segment display.
